# Travelling-salesmen-Genetic-Algo
A traveling salesman needs to go through n cities to sell his merchandise. There's a road between each two cities, but some roads are longer and more dangerous than others. Given the cities and the cost of traveling between each two cities, what's the cheapest way for the salesman to visit all of the cities and come back to the starting city, without passing through any city twice.

Although this may seem like a simple feat, it's worth noting that this is an NP-hard problem. There's no algorithm to solve it in polynomial time. Genetic algorithm can only approximate the solution.
